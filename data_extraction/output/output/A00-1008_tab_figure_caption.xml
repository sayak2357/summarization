		<figure>Figure 5 shows an example of text that can be generated by the Atlas-Andes system, showing an analogy-based approach to teaching this content. The operator library used to generate this text could generate a combinatorially large number of versions of this dialogue as well as selected examples of other ways of teaching about direction of acceleration. This operator library used to generate this text contained 1 l 1 plan operators, divided as follows: </figure>
